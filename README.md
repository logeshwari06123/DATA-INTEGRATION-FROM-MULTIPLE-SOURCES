DESCRIPTION  : In Power BI, data integration from multiple sources enables comprehensive analysis and reporting. 
This project involves importing and combining data from both SQL Server and Excel to create a unified data model for dynamic dashboards and insightful visualizations.
SQL Server: Power BI connects directly to the SQL database to import structured data such as transactions, customer details, or inventory information.
Using native queries or Power Query, data is filtered and shaped at the source to optimize performance.
Excel File: Supplementary or reference data, such as lookup tables, budget plans, or manually maintained records, are imported from Excel.
Power BI allows for easy transformation of this data to match the schema of the SQL data.
